# Moore Accuracy Lab
Hello! This is the start of a collective Github for all code/analysis for Professor Moore's research group

The purpose of this Github organisation is to help foster better code workflow and allow for members to collaborate on a single research project with ease

Individual research projects should start their own repositories where members can pull code from

Do contact me at jeffreyzhou@berkeley.edu if you have any setup questions!
